    "abstract": "We report on the effect of intermolecular forces on the fluctuations of supported liquid films. Using an optically induced thermal gradient, we form nanometer-thin films of wetting liquids on glass substrates, where van der Waals forces are balanced by thermocapillary forces. We show that the fluctuation dynamics of the film interface is strongly modified by intermolecular forces at lower frequencies. Data spanning three frequency decades are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions accounting for van der Waals forces. Our results emphasize the relevance of intermolecular forces on thermal fluctuations when fluids are confined at the nanoscale.",
